# Phylogeny of Yellow Fever Virus, Uganda, 2016
In April 2016 , cases of yellow fever were dentified in the southwestern district, Masaka, of Uganda . By June 2016, the Ministry 
of Health of Uganda had reported 68 suspected yellow fever cases, of which 3 probable and 7 confirmed cases were in the Masaka, 
Rukungiri, and Kalangala districts.
## Methodology 
Presence of YFV RNA in human clinical samples confirmed using real-time reverse transcription PCR.
One serum sample was then selected for NGS because of its relative concentration of viral RNA (Determined by cycle threshold <30).The sample
was then sequenced using Ion torrent sequencing technology. 
This first round of  sequencing, resulted in none of the  sequence reads aligning to the YFV reference template indicative that the YFV
RNA in the sample was of low quality and/or quantity. The RNA sample was therefore subjected to a targeted RNase-H digestion 
to remove the contaminating carrier and ribosomal RNA. This step was performed so as to increase the sequencing coverage, probably
to increase chances of detecting infectious genetic material of YFV. A standard cDNA library was prepared and Ion torrent sequencing
was performed. Fastq files generated were aligned again to YFV reference template using SeqMan NGen (DNASTAR).This second round of 
sequencing (after RNase-H treatment) resulted in 1.2% of all sequencing reads aligning to about 38% of the complete YFV genome.
The longest and deepest coverage contigs were then taken through BLAST analyses. BlAST analyses determined that the Uganda 2016 strain
is closely related to strains from South Sudan 2003 which confers to about 95% similarity (specifically in the envelope region).
This is in contrast to the similarity observed between Uganda 2016 and Angola 2016 which conferred to about 83% similarity in the same 
region. This result shows that the Uganda 2016 strain was not birthed by the Angola 2016 strain but rather this outbreaks were 
independent of each other. The study goes further ahead to compare the NS genes of the Uganda 2016 with previous outbreaks. The finding
suggests that the NS genes (NS3 and NS5) of Uganda 2016 have the closest similarity to a Uganda 1948 strain. However it is worth noting
that only specific regions were being compared in this study. They compared the non-structural genes and envelope regions of the 
YFV
