# Characterization of transmission dynamics of recent VHF outbreaks in Uganda: New outbreaks or on-going transmissions?
## ABSTRACT
### Background
Uganda has experienced repeated outbreaks of viral hemorrhagic fevers (VHFs) over the last 20 years with Ebola, Marburg, Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF), Yellow fever, and Rift valley fever
(RVF) among those reported [1, 2]. Ebola occurred in Gulu in 2000; Bundibugyo in 2007; Luweero in 2011; Luweero in 2012; and Kibaale in 2012. Marburg was reported in Ibanda in 2007; and two outbreaks in Ibanda and Kabale in 2012; Kampala in 2014; and Kween in 2017. CCHF occurred in Wakiso twice in 2013; Nakaseke/Luweero in 2015; Kiboga in 2017; and Luweero in 2017. In 2010 an enhanced VHF surveillance and diagnostics system was introduced at the national reference laboratory facility at the Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI) resulting in improved detection and control of VHF outbreaks[3]. With enhanced surveillance, subsequent outbreaks have tended to be detected much earlier, more frequently and intervention responses rapidly mounted resulting in a significant decrease in the overall intensity (P=0.001), duration (P<0.0001) and case fatalities of recent VHF outbreaks compared to the pre-2010 period [3]. However, recent data have revealed that for Ebola, survivors may
shed virus long after recovery [4], This opens the possibility that some recently observed cases might partly be due to continued human to human transmission from survivors as opposed to new
outbreaks after zoonosis.
### Goal and research question
To better understand the transmission dynamics of recent VHF outbreaks and whether survivors might contribute to subsequent outbreaks.
### Rationale
Phylogenetics with full virus genomes can link infections and reveal patterns in virus transmission [5]. The results of this project could provide information on transmission dynamics of recent VHF outbreaks as well as inform strategies for future responses and containment.
### Methods
This study will generate full genome sequences from VHF samples available at UVRI. These new data, combined with data from Ebola, Marburg and CCHF outbreaks will be examined to determine phylogenetic linkage between temporally distinct outbreaks.
